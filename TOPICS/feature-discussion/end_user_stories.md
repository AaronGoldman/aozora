#### As an end user, I want to be able to:

      - post in any context, to any user
      - have my post seen in context, and by those who trust/value me

      - see things of value to me
               - from direct interactions
               - in contexts I choose or am interested in
               - from users I follow
               - from users I trust/value based on some rules or algorithms (ranking)

      - not see things I find objectionable or spammy (filtering)
      - report posts/users that appear false and/or malicious
      - not be seen by specific users or groups (blocking) 
      - ability to post that can be seen only by an individual or group of users (private messages)

      - display formats that are meaningful to me
             - threads of conversations
             - previews and multimedia
             - context switching - work/family/project

      - easy and effortless interface
      - safety - my geolocation and IP address should be protected from attackers
      - monetization - it would be nice to be able to monetize high quality content I produce
      - statistics - know how many people have seen my posts
      - ads or fees - it would be nice to choose whether to pay a fee or see ads

#### What is an end user?

This is a (generally non-technical) person using an application built on the bluesky protocol for reading and posting messages.  This user generally will not directly interact with the protocol itself.
