#### as a filter/ranking algo developer, I want to be able to:

       - identify producers of spam/malicious content
       - identify the 'bad' content itself
       - identify content that is intended to do harm in the physical world
       - receive reports of bad actors/bad content

       - given some DNA fingerprint of a community or a user, curate/rank top content for them
       - receive (rapid) feedback to improve future rankings 
       - receive streams of new content along with meta parameters on the content
       
       - monetize the service provided
       
#### what is a filter/ranking algo developer?

The concept here is that some functions that may benefit from large scale or centralized data, such as serving recommended content or filtering undesirable content/bad actors,
may be developed independently and will need to communicate with the other players in the ecosystem.
