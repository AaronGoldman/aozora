Decentralized Identity

- A good [primer](https://spruceid.dev/docs/primer) on the subject
- The Decentralized Identifier Specification, aka the "[DID-core spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)"" at W3C
- The Verifiable Credentials Data Model Specification, aka the "[VC spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)"
- The Decentralized Identity Foundation's ["FAQ"](https://identity.foundation) (more of a knowledgebase, really) - a very technical resource, good for navigating the existing libraries, standards, and pre-standards specifications and OS implementations

## Core issues

- do users self-register?
- are accounts bound by one or more terms of service?
- who manages accounts, and to whom are they responsible, accountable, and/or liable?
- how (and at what layer/points in the architecture) is traffic governed and/or regulated?
- can users opt in to linking their accounts to external authorities?
  - If so, which authorities, and who decides when to add or substract authorities individually or in classes?

## Architectural questions

- where is each account's data stored?
- how is this crawled?
- how can crawling and replication be decentralized/multi-centric?
