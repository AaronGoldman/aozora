# Identity Use Cases for Discussion

```
    service provider: app developer, server administrator, any entity 
                      handling users' data or providing a user interface
```

As a service provider, I want to know that a user has given me permission to post on their behalf from a given human verified identity.

As a service provider, I want to know that a user corresponds with a specific entity or account that has attestations of credibility

As a user, I want to be able to switch between applications and contexts without re-logging in or re-verifying my identity

As a user, I want to know that a particular entity I am interacting with has been under the same control over time and see attestations that this entity is credible.  In particular, in the case of transferring funds.

As a service provider, I want to know that a user has given me permission to communicate with them in a particular way - for example that I have permission to send them a direct message on Twitter, or to send them an email

As a social-media user, I want to block an individual whom I consider toxic "globally", i.e. on all the places where they publish.  Conversely, I want to globally follow someone I admire. Furthermore, whether blocking or following, I want this to apply to new social-media identities for the individual even if they're created after my initial block/follow.
