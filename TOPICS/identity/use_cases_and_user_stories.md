# Identity Use Cases for Discussion

As a user, I want to be able to switch between applications and contexts without re-logging in or re-verifying my identity

As a user, I want to know that a particular entity I am interacting with has been under the same control over time and see attestations that this entity is credible.  In particular, in the case of transferring funds.

As an app developer, I want to know that a user has given me permission to communicate with them in a particular way - for example that I have permission to send them a direct message on Twitter, or to send them an email

As an app developer, I want to know that a user has given me permission to post on their behalf from a given human verified identity.

As an app developer, I want to know that a user corresponds with a specific entity or account that has attestations of credibility

(in a federated world, the app developer could be exchanged with a server administrator)
