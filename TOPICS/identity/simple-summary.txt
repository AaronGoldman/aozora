identity means

 - gain access to resources that are unique to me
 - be able to post or take actions that can be identified as coming from me
 - others can discover or refer to me and my actions

can rely on

  - attestations from trusted source (OAuth) which is logged into w password
  - keypair (signed messages can be verified with public key)
       - pubkey may be available on public blockchain or trusted source
  - assets (device id, 2FA)
  - social graph validation (3FA)


For an app to use decentralized identity, a user arrives at and wants to login or create a post
   - is there a simple method to lookup the pubkey similar to OAuth?
   - can we combine trusted source and blockchain verifiers?
   - can we include standard methods for adding 2FA to verify decentralized identities?


Once identity is possible, reputation layers may be added on top such as 
    KyC - proof of a legal specific identity, or 
    PoH - proof of humanity


codelab - integration of existing stack into an app to provide identity

 - how does activitypub do it?
 - how does matrix do it?
 - how does gun/iris do it?

can we bridge across any of these?
