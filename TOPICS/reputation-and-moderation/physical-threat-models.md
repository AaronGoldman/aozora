# Addressing physical harm/violence

Often, social media is used as a threat vector by those who wish to do harm.

Names of targets may be distributed to followers in a loose call to action, and also
once a target has been forcibly disappeared or killed, social media is used to smear the reputation of the individual and make it appear the action was justified.  Threats followed by actual violence are also a key way of silencing individuals on social media. 

Multiple protective mechanisms will be needed to address these threats.  Note this is a particular challenge in areas in which no effective government structures exist for protecting individuals, or of course in areas in which the government itself is the one performing extrajudicial violence.  Most social media moderation is generally intended for areas in which 'normal' governmental and societal rules apply; new methods are needed for areas in which this assumption is invalid. 

A few novel methods are listed below as candidates:

### ban for justifications of kidnappings

Currently, Youtube is hosting a video by Iraqi Hezbollah denigrating two journalists who are kidnapped in Iraq.  The video itself does not make physical threats of harm, it simply lists times that the kidnapped individual was associated with Iraqi Jews and Israelis.  However, this is understood to be a justification for harming this individual who is currently being held.  Yet since the video does not meet criteria for suspension, the poster is still on Youtube and the video remains, despite it being raised at high levels and reported directly.

Creating an endpoint for credible recording of enforced disappearances, kidnappings and extrajudicial killings, would allow a different standard to be enforced for negative statements about individuals who have already been subjected to those violent acts.  

Speaking negatively about a person who is vulnerable because they are being held in a prison system in an extrajudicial manner, is and should be treated differently than speaking negatively about a free person.  Having a reporting system would enable this to be done in a systematic manner.

### post-ban for justifications leading to kidnappings/killings

Similarly, individuals posting negative or slightly threatening information about a free individual, could be banned after the fact if that individual is then killed or kidnapped. 

### "death trigger" as disincentive for silencing of journalists

Another frequent method of violent repression is to disappear or kill an individual in retaliation for their posts on social media, in order to silence those posts.  Currently this is an effective mechanism, as when a person is deceased they can no longer post, and in fact their account may sometimes be disabled or removed after their death.

If, however, a person who is aware of being targeted could store draft messages and videos to be released only upon their death or disappearance, and could provide a trigger mechanism to release those drafts, a disincentive could be created as the death would do the opposite of silencing a person.

For example, an individual might have detailed information about crimes by high level officials, but might be afraid to release that information during their lifetime.  By creating an automatic trigger for the information to be released on their death, that is not under the control of their family (and thus the family could not be subject to blackmail), a strong disincentive could be created for killing journalists and other individuals who might have access to such information.  

The 'death trigger' could be set to go off if the person does NOT have access to their account for a year or more, in order to avoid the also common situation in which the person is disappeared and no death certificate is available.

An interesting way to avoid accidental triggers, generate interest in the content, and also to possibly cause a merely kidnapped person to be kept alive, would be if the trigger had a teaser/warning that would go off prior to the actual release: "This account has a death/inactivity trigger which will cause a post with the subject XXXX to be released in 30 days" etc.  This would need to be combined with a heavyweight security requirement for reenabling the account beyond password, maybe including social verification.

Standard mechanisms and trust/safety integrations will also be needed, of course, but novel techniques may be needed to address user safety in regions where governmental action is not possible.
