## Accountability and Reputation

This doc is interested in particular in the cases when physical harm is done to individuals after a concerted social media campaign against them.

While difficult to prevent, one simple rule to provide a form of accountability is proposed:

Analysis for negative sentiment recently directed towards an individual who is killed or disappeared in an extrajudicial manner, could have a heavy penalty attached.  This could be automated pretty easily, and tho its 'too late' at that time, it provides at least some accountability. 

The penalty should also apply to assets associated with the indicated content, ie usernames, IP addresses, mobile device identifiers.  To be effective, the reputation must apply to all high value assets associated with the attack.

If a penalty is also applied to the originating platform, this would incentivize different preventative measures on behalf of the platform moderators.  

Note, because the targets of attacks may have significantly much less resources than the attackers, and less social network of powerful individuals, it is likely necessary to have a federated agreement on principles to protect targeted individuals.

With caution, it may also help to 'name and shame' accounts and platforms that participated in the leadup to a violent event.  However, care must obviously be taken not to cause violent retaliation.
