# GUN Modular UI Working Group

Explore how unopinionated modular UI can be made with component-driven design, and with a standardised design language and grammar that is framework and design software agnostic.

This can expand into an open-source ecosystem of design/front-end modules that can be used to build an app on top of a system like Mastodon or Bluesky.

**Description of group:** Prototype an open and unopinionated design specification that allows one to build the front-end of an app or design system on top of a protocol such as GUN, intially demoing with GUN auth and note/post writing.
