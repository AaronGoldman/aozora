# Templates - use cases, user stories

## User Stories
A user story or scenario is a short statement that identifies the person interacting with your product and the action they need to take in order to realize a certain result/ benefit.

- As a [persona], I want to [action/feature] so that I can [benefit].

## Use Cases
A use case is more detailed than a user story and provides a general guideline for the steps a user needs to take in order to perform a task. Use cases can be a bulleted list or more detailed prose.

- Objective/ Goal
- Users/ Actors
- Steps/ Flow
- Alternative Steps/ Failure scenario
- Additional info: preconditions, event triggers, secondary actors etc

## Example
USER STORY
- As a [end-user], I want a [to edit/delete prior posts], so that [my online persona evolves as I evolve].

USE CASE
- Objective: edit a post
- Primary Actors: end-user
- Secondary Actor: users tagged in post

Steps:
- user logs into application
- user selects post to edit
- user makes changes (ex: removes photos, edits text, deletes post)
- user saves changes
- user publishes post
