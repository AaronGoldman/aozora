## Getting Started

** Goals, scope and literature **

The original Goals and Scope document that Twitter vetted has now been added to our repo:
https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community/flow/-/blob/main/original-goals-and-scope.md

As well as the original suggested readings, that Jay just referenced here
https://discord.com/channels/867838494897078302/877657223902425158/880523332552917032

** How To Contribute **

1) The simplest first way to contribute is to try out code or apps from blueskycommunity.net, and report in #in-the-wild!  

2) Become a Topic editor!  Maintain Markdown docs in each channel with key links, and check them periodically into our gitlab (ping me for perms)

3) Join a Working Group  (see below)

4) Pop in to a discussion or offer to sync up - see https://join.whatscookin.us/circle/bluesky-community - the next discussion is happening in half an hr at 1PM PT in https://jitsi.modular.im/bluesky-community
You can make offers here, and plan them when someone is interested in joining you.

** Working Groups **

These may evolve quickly so check in Discord and gitlab for the latest!  Currently we have

 - codelabs-and-use-cases  @Elena#1246 or @Hemmy#1250
 - event-organizing @schwentker#8369
 - indexing rss3 @Usagi#8964
 - verus openid connect @miketout#8148
 - gun-modular-ui @marknadal#0014 or @macintoshhelper#8487 
 - reputation-feed @Golda#4168 or @Nick L#0043 

The idea is that discussion happens in the discord, and design, docs or key links that crystalize out should be checked into the gitlab in the corresponding directory https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community/flow
