# Getting Started

## Goals, scope and literature 

The original Goals and Scope document that Twitter vetted has now been added to our repo:
https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community/flow/-/blob/main/original-goals-and-scope.md

As well as the original suggested readings, as referenced here
https://discord.com/channels/867838494897078302/877657223902425158/880523332552917032

## How To Contribute

1) The simplest first way to contribute is to try out code or apps from blueskycommunity.net, and report in #in-the-wild!  

2) Become a Topic editor!  Maintain Markdown docs in each channel with key links, and check them periodically into our gitlab (ping me for perms)

3) Join a Working Group - check out the discussions in the discord, or look through [working groups](https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community/flow/-/tree/main/WORKING_GROUPS)

4) Pop in to a discussion or offer to sync up - see https://join.whatscookin.us/circle/bluesky-community 
You can make offers here, and plan them when someone is interested in joining you.


## Structure

The idea is that discussion happens in the discord, and design, docs or key links that crystalize out should be checked into this repo in the corresponding directory.
